# dotfiles
You know what these are for.

Tested in ArchLinux, default kernel, rolling release.

The neovim config requires python-neovim & python2-neovim, or the equivalent for your distro.

The bspwm & sxhkd config requires dmenu for launching programs.

Previously I used exclusively openbox, but lately I've been trying bspwm and I'm rather impressed.
I've also switched from terminator to termite. I am leaving the old config files in, if you prefer openbox & terminator.
